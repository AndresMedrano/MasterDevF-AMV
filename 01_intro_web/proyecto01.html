            matches being played
            between AlphaGo (Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion), we
            look at the history of
            <i> Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</i>

        <p>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built. In many
            cases, these philosophical and
            ethical wrestlings have made for great drama —think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Often, the
            hypothetical scenarios we envision
            come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and
            Machine Learning make clear that a
            “computer with a mind of its own” is <strike> going to take over the world </strike> not such a fantastic
            thing to imagine any longer.</p>

    <h2>The Triumph Of Deep Blue</h2>

    <article>
        <p>Perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs. machine competitions, because the idea of being
            overcome by that which we’ve
            created speaks to something very deep within our collective consciousness. When IBM’s Deep Blue faced off
            against Garry Kasparov <sup>1</sup> , the
            event resulted in more than <a href="https://www.ibm.com/hi-en/about" target="_blank">three billion
                impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the champions on
            Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</p>

    <h2>DeepMind’s AlphaGo</h2>
    
    <article>
        <p>Taking place right now, there is an event that, while not likely to scale the same media heights, may in fact have far greater implications
            when it comes to the future of “intelligent” machines. On March 9, in Seoul, South Korea, a computing system know as AlphoGo (built by
            researchers at DeepMind—a Google Artificial Intelligence lab) began <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/04/youtube-will-livestream-googles-ai-playing-go-superstar-lee-sedol-in-march/ target="_blank">a five-game match</a> around the world, and when IBM’s later creation Watson challenged the champions on
            Jeopardy, millions of viewers were glued to the proceedings.</p>
        
        <p>Why is this so significant?</p>

        <p>Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper <a href="http://airesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/deepmind-mastering-go.pdf" target="_blank">Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search:</a> </p>

        <p><i>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space
            and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</i></p>

        <p>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can “think” on their own, because
            success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge, and experience. It requires intuition.
            Feel. Style. Characteristics we associate with humans, not with machines.</p>
